QA(quality assurance) : is a way of preventing defects in manufactured products and avoiding problems
when delivering services to customers

tester roles :

functional tester : to test the functionality of an application so that it meets business requirements
automation tester : write the code and make machine to work
performance tester : to test the load of application. No of users accessing app at same time
mobile tester : to test app in mobile how it is behaving in diff platforms ex: e commerce,banking app's
security/pen testing : authentication,hacking,identify security flaws
Test Architect : high level position in QA.dev a framework to write automation scripting,has to set
road map,take care of all testing activities

All testers work for quality of the product

diff stages of testing :
test planning,analysis and design,implementation and execution,evaluating exit criteria and reporting,
test closure activities

test planning :
define scope of testing,determine test approach,define test strategy,determine test resources,exit criteria

analysis and design :
analysis business requirements,design test scenarios,create test data,design test cases based on
test scenarios,test environment setup

Implementation and execution :
execute test cases in given timeline,prioritize test cases,write automation scripts if necessary,
defect loging and tracking,test case status reporting

evaluating exit criteria and reporting :
to check the test status against exit criteria specified in test planning
to assess if more test are need or exit criteria should be changed
to write test summary report for stakeholders

test case template :
business req id,test case id,tc description,pre requisite,test data,test steps,expected,actual,status(pass/fail)


defect life cycle :
new : qa raised the defect
open : test manager changes the status/ developer goes through and checks valid or not
assigned : assign to particular developer will work on it
fixed : dev fixes the defect
retest : checks whether the defect is fixed or not
closed : if defect is fixed
reopen:if raised defect is not fixed
reject : if dev thinks the defect raised is not valid
deferred : postponed to next release

defect template :
defect ID : unique id for every defect
description : password reset happening after clicking cancel
steps to reproduce : all steps to produce the defect
test data : data to raise the defect
expected result : pswd reset should not happen
actual result : pswd reset is happening
screenshot : 
timestamp : at what time we got the defect
assigned to : test manager/developer
severity :impact of defect in the application( low, medium , high)
priority : the order of the defect to be fixed
------------------------------------------------------------------------
functional requirement : any part of the app
non-func req : no of users access at a time(performance,load,stress,security)

smoke testing : performed after softwaree build(bug fixed) to check the critical funt of the application is 
working fine
performed before actual testing

sanity testing : performed when the bugs have been fixed and no further issues are introduced becoz of
those fixed bugs
only for one module

sanity is same as regression testing(but done for whole application)

load testing : testing the app at diff load. no of users accessing the app at same time
stress testing : testing till the app breaks at a certain point
---------------------------------------------------------------------
testing methodologies :
water fall,iterative and agile

water fall : after complete developing is done then it comes to testing

iterative : project is divided into modules . After development of each module testing is performed.

Agile : both dev and testing is performed parallely.
srum methodology : scrum is the process in agile.To adopt agile methodology there are few framworks.
scrum is one of those framework.
Every two weeks we have a release(called sprint)
test cases are called user stories. these user stories are given to dev and tester.

scrum is the management framework/protocol/process for incremental product development
there are 3 roles in scrum method of agile software development .
product owner,scrum master(monitor progress) and team

sprint planning meeting : product owner decides which req need to pick from product backlog

daily scrum : 15min meeting in a day. All will come to a place and discuss about the progress.
like what task he performed on that day and what he is going to perform tomorrow

sprint review meeting : after dev and tester has done their jobs,they will give demo to the higher officials
like product owner.May be happens at the end of the sprint or every day

sprint retrospective meeting : review their work,process,any changes to made in that sprint.
what we learnt,how we need to focus in next sprint,drawbacks.

Backlog refinement meeting : product owner sits with dev and decides what req to develop first and what
next.
